/**Grid bag layout class that has additional convenience functionality,
	including box layout and border layout functionality.
<p>This layout can be used in place of {@link BorderLayout} either by using
	the {@link BorderLayout} constraints or, preferably, by using one of
	the <code>createBorderConstraints()</code> in this class. Border layout
	functionality is enhanced by allowing multiple components in each border,
	the total number in both directions together limited by
	{@link GridBagLayout#MAXGRIDSIZE}.</p>
<p>A component with a basic grid bag layout can be used in place of a horizontal
	or vertical {@link Box}, with the added benefit that weights
	can be assigned to each component, using <code>createNextBoxConstraints()</code>
	for layout constraints when adding components. For example, a vertical layout
	might add a {@link Box#createGlue()} at the end using constraints of
	<code>createNextBoxConstraints(BasicGridBagLayout.X_AXIS, 1.0)</code>.</p>
